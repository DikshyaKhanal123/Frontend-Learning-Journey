    <h1> Akshay Kumar</h1><hr>
    <p>Akshay Hari Om Bhatia[1] (born Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia; 9 September 1967[2]), known professionally as Akshay Kumar (pronounced [əkˈʂəj kʊˈmaːɾ]), is an Indian actor and film producer working <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema">Hindi cinema</a>. Referred to in the media as "Khiladi Kumar",[3][4] through his career spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared in over 150 films and has won several awards, including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards. He received the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian honour, from the Government of India in 2009. Kumar is one of the most prolific actors in Indian cinema.[5][6] Forbes included Kumar in their lists of both highest-paid celebrities and highest-paid actors in the world from 2015 to 2020.[7][8] Between 2019 and 2020, he was the only Indian on both lists.[9][10][11] In 2021, Kumar was awarded the highest tax payer "Sanman Patra" for consecutively paying the highest tax as an individual for the past five years.[12]</p>
<p>Kumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first commercial success a year later with the action thriller Khiladi. The film established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several films in the Khiladi film series, in addition to other action films such as Mohra (1994) and Jaanwar (1999). Although his early tryst with romance in Yeh Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that Kumar expanded his range of roles. He gained recognition for the romantic films Dhadkan (2000), Andaaz (2003), Namastey London (2007), and for his slapstick comic performances in several films including Hera Pheri (2000), Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), and Singh Is Kinng (2008). Kumar won Filmfare Awards for his negative role in Ajnabee (2001) and his comic performance in Garam Masala (2005).</p>
<p>While his career had fluctuated commercially, his mainstream success soared in 2007 with four consecutive box-office hits; it was consistent until a short period of decline between 2009 and 2011, after which he reinforced his status with several films, including Rowdy Rathore (2012) and Holiday (2014). Moreover, around this time critical response to several of his films improved; his work in Special 26 (2013), Baby (2015), Airlift (2016), and Jolly LLB 2 (2017) was acclaimed, and he won the National Film Award for Best Actor for the crime thriller Rustom (2016). He earned further notice for his self-produced social films Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017) and Pad Man (2018), as well as the war film Kesari (2019), and set box-office records in 2019 with Kesari, Mission Mangal, Housefull 4, Good Newwz, and the 2021 action film Sooryavanshi. All of Kumar's subsequent theatrical releases failed commercially, with the exception of the comedy-drama OMG 2 (2023).[13]</p>
<p>In addition to acting, Kumar has worked as a stunt actor.[a] In 2008, he started hosting Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi, which he did for four seasons. He also launched the TV reality show Dare 2 Dance in 2014 and his off-screen work includes ownership of the team Khalsa Warriors in the World Kabaddi League. The actor had also set up martial arts training schools for women safety in the country.[15][16] Kumar is one of the India's most philanthropic actor and supports various charities. He is a brand endorser celebrity in India.[17] From 2011 to 2023, he was a citizen of Canada.[18][19][20]</p>

<p>From a young age, Kumar was very interested in sports, and his father also enjoyed wrestling. He lived and grew up in Delhi's Chandni Chowk and later moved to Bombay, Maharashtra, when his father left the Army to become an accountant with UNICEF.[21] Soon, his sister was born, and the family lived in Koliwada, a Punjabi dominated area of Central Bombay.[22</p>

<h2>Film career</h2><hr>
<h3> <b>1991–1999: Debut, breakthrough and action films</b></h3>
<p>Kumar made his first appearance as the lead actor opposite Raakhee and Shantipriya in Saugandh (1991). In the same year, he acted in Kishore Vyas-directed Dancer, which received poor reviews.[36] The following year he starred in Abbas Mustan-directed suspense thriller, Khiladi, widely considered his breakthrough role.[37][38] A review in The Indian Express called the film "an engrossing thriller" and described Kumar as impressive in the lead part, noting his physical appearance, strong screen presence, and commending him for being "perfectly at ease".[39] His next release was the Raj Sippy-directed detective film Mr. Bond, based on James Bond.[40] His last release of 1992 was Deedar. It failed to perform well at the box office.[41]</p>
<p>In 1993, he acted in the Keshu Ramsay-directed bilingual film Ashaant alongside Dr. Vishnuvardhan and Ashwini Bhave. Almost all of his films released during 1993, including Dil Ki Baazi, Kayda Kanoon and Sainik did not perform well commercially.[42] In 1994, he appeared in 11 feature films.[43] He played a police inspector in two films: Sameer Malkan's Main Khiladi Tu Anari and Rajiv Rai's Mohra, both among the highest-grossing films of the year.[44] Further success came later that year when he starred in Yash Chopra-produced romance Yeh Dillagi, opposite Kajol. One of the year's biggest mainstream successes, both the film and his performance were received well by critics, with The Indian Express describing him as "always dependable" and singling out his performance.[45] His work in the film earned him his first nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare Awards[46] and the Screen Awards.[42] During the same year, Kumar also had success with films like Suhaag and the low-budget action film Elaan. All these achievements established Kumar as one of the most successful actors of the year, according to Box Office India.[47]</p>

<h3><b>2000–2006: Established actor and expansion to comedy films</b></h3>
<p>n 2000, Kumar starred in the Priyadarshan-directed comedy Hera Pheri alongside Paresh Rawal and Suneil Shetty. The film which was a remake of Malayalam film Ramji Rao Speaking,[58] became a commercial success[59] and proved to be a turning point in Kumar's career.[60] Hindustan Times noted the film's "intense portrayal of the surreality of the human condition".[61] He also starred in the Dharmesh Darshan-directed romantic drama Dhadkan later that same year. The film performed moderately at the box office[59] but Kumar was praised for his acting.[62][63] Rediff.com's review stated that he had proved that he is "director's actor" and that "he has worked hard on his role is apparent."[64] That same year, he performed some of his most dangerous stunts in Neeraj Vora-directed action thriller Khiladi 420, where he climbed a running plane, stood on top of the plane flying a thousand feet in the air, and jumped from the plane onto a hot air balloon. In a later scene, he is also seen being chased by a car, dodging bullets, jumping off buildings, and climbing walls.[65] His character in the film had two names and his role received mixed reviews.[66] Sukanya Verma wrote "Negative roles and Akshay Kumar don't go hand-in-hand. [...] Akshay is ridiculously over the top and irritating to the core. However, he manages a decent performance as the sober and suave Anand."[67] Padmaraj Nair of Screen, however, believed it was "the best performance of his career".[68]</p>
